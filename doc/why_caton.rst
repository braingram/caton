Why the name "Caton"?
***********************

Richard Caton was the first man to record electrical signals in the brain. Using an unamplified galvanometer on the surface of the cortex, he found that a negative change in potential often accompanied behavior or sensory stimulation. He was able to locate the part of cortex used in vision. He performed the visual stimulation with a gas-light!
